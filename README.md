#Test repository

##Status so far...
So far, I have tried the following:
* Cloned a repo
* Configured remote/upstream
* Fetched upstream
* Merged upstream
* Branched test-repo
* Edited files
##Coming up next...
Now, I have to do the following
* Add edited files to the local repo index
* Commit and send a message
* Push the changes to GitHub
* Initiate pull request at GitHub
##Things I don't yet understand
* How to remove branches from local Git
* and many other things!
